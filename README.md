Chez Euler
==========

Implementations of Eratosthenes sieve, totient sieve, Miller-Rabin,
Pollard's rho algorithm, and Euclid's algorithm. I use this to solve
Project Euler problems, mostly.

See the [org file](/chez-euler.org) for lame tests as well as some
Project Euler solutions for which there's not much left to do once the
library procedures are in place.
